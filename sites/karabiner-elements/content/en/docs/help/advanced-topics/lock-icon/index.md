Prior to Karabiner-Elements 14.10.0, a lock indicator is shown on Karabiner-Elements and Karabiner-EventViewer icon.

These indicators show that these files are protected so that they cannot be deleted from Finder.

## Why these files are protected

This protection is intended to prevent incomplete uninstallation.

Karabiner-Elements is a system-wide software, and [files are installed in appropriate locations](../installed-files/) besides the Applications folder.

Therefore, if you just put the application icon in Trash like a normal app uninstallation, some files will be left behind.

The file protection forces to use [the built-in uninstaller](/docs/manual/operation/uninstall) and remove installed files properly at the uninstallation.

This file locking is achieved with `schg` and `uchg` flags.

You can unlock these files by the following commands in Terminal.

```shell
sudo chflags nouchg,noschg /Applications/Karabiner-Elements.app
sudo chflags nouchg,noschg /Applications/Karabiner-EventViewer.app
```

(Administrator password is required to run the above command.)
