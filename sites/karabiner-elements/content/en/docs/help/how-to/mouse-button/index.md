Karabiner-Elements does not modify mouse devices by default.

1.  You have to enable your mouse on Karabiner-Elements Settings > Devices.

2.  Then, use Simple Modifications to assign a key to a button or
    use [Complex Modifications](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#mouse_button) for more advanced usage.
