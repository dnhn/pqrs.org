You can change the icons that appear in the Finder, Launchpad, Dock, etc from Settings > UI.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}

The icon in Dock will not reflect changes while the application is open.
So, you should close and reopen the application to update the icon in Dock.

{{% /alert %}}

{{< local-image src="images/app-icon@2x.png" >}}
